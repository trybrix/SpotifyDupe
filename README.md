# SpotifyDupe
Testing testing 123...
This is just Spotify dupe with notes to learn HTML and CSS.<br>
I will make a new repo or tie in when I learn JS/TS.<br>

This is done with the help (all the help) of Omerko on YT with the title of "Build a Spotify Clone with HTML & CSS"<br>
The source code is available in the description of the video but writing the code itself and taking notes works wonder.<br>

Again, this is just a Spotify dupe for me to learn HTML & CSS.
